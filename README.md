Overview
This report offers a comprehensive analysis of the Dry Bean Dataset (UCI ML Repository ID: 602).

Methodology
Data Loading: The Dry Bean Dataset is loaded using the UCI ML Repository API.
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is split into features (X) and target (y). A train-test split is performed for model evaluation.
Model Selection: A Nu-Support Vector Classifier (NuSVC) with Bayesian Optimization is employed to optimize hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation: The model's accuracy is evaluated using cross-validation and convergence plots.
Result Analysis: The best hyperparameters and accuracy obtained are analyzed.
Dataset Description
The Dry Bean Dataset comprises various attributes of dry beans, including geometric, shape, and texture attributes, used for bean classification.

Features
The dataset includes the following features:

Area
Perimeter
MajorAxisLength
MinorAxisLength
AspectRatio
Eccentricity
ConvexArea
EquivDiameter
Extent
Solidity
Roundness
Compactness
ShapeFactor1
ShapeFactor2
ShapeFactor3
ShapeFactor4
Target
The target variable represents the class of the dry bean.

Data Exploration
Basic exploratory data analysis is performed:

Summary Statistics
# Summary statistics of the dataset
summary_statistics = X.describe()
print(summary_statistics)
# Class distribution
class_distribution = y['Class'].value_counts()
print(class_distribution)
import seaborn as sns
# Calculate correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = X.corr()
